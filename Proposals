### ðŸ›¡ Context  
This is the **first-ever AIRE DAO proposal**.  
The $AIRE token is not live yet, but this bootstrapped proposal simulates DAO governance logic and will be retroactively included in the **Genesis DAO Budget**.

Funds will be transparently tracked and routed via the multisig wallet of **Building Greatness SpA** (pre-launch legal host).  

All deliverables will be published, verified, and community-reviewed.

**Web4 begins here. Reputation is Capital.  
Letâ€™s build sovereignty by action.**
